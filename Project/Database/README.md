1. This service is used to store data that pertains to our application. 
2. We are using MySQL for our data store.
3. The current DB schema supports 2 tables - *Post* and *Comment*. The schema is subject to change as the project evolves.
4. The containerized database is auto intialized and populated with mock data on start up. Refer to the root directory's README on how to start up the application in development mode.
